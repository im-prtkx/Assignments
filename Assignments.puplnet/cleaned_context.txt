I use single and multi-collector ICP-MS, electron microprobe (EPMA), optical microscopes, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and as all Earth Scientist do - field work for most of my research activities. My current research projects proves the impact of climate change on high-altitude cryosphere, constrain the response of Surface Earth System to past climate perturbations, application of inorganic tracers in hydrocarbon exploration, as well as source apportionment of airborne particulate matters. My research interest therefore frequently overlaps various Earth Systems such as the solid Earth, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, but I address all of them using the radiogenic and stable isotopes.

In addition, I intend to set a bridge between deformation and metamorphic processes, and explain deep-crustal phenomena, like partial melting and melt migration. The application of my research work covers a range of subjects- structural geology, tectonics, petrology and geodynamics, with a special emphasis on important factors controlling strain localization and deformation mechanisms during tectonic movement of lithospheric plates. The key tools I employ to understand these processes include mostly experimental rock deformations under elevated pressure-temperature conditions and field investigations, coupled with analytical and numerical modelling. + - Mathematics & Statistics Click to collapse Abhijit Pal (abhipal[AT]iitk.ac.in) PhD (Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata) Phone: 0512-259-6405 (O) Research Interests: Relatively Hyperbolic Groups, Mapping Class Groups.
